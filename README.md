🚀 NM-2025 – AI & CV Project Portfolio
This repository showcases four innovative projects built in 2025 as part of my AI and Computer Vision learning journey. These projects were designed to solve real-world problems using a mix of deep learning, image processing, and intelligent systems.

🧠 Projects Overview
#	Project	Description
1️⃣	Capestone - Currency Node Authentication	A system to verify and authenticate Indian currency notes using image processing and edge detection techniques. Helps reduce counterfeit circulation.
2️⃣	Autonomous Dome Surveillance System	A smart surveillance system that uses real-time object tracking and movement prediction for enhanced security monitoring in public or restricted spaces.
3️⃣	Food Quality Inspection using CNN	Deep learning model that classifies food quality (fresh, spoiled, etc.) using image-based features. Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
4️⃣	Underwater Object Detection	A computer vision project to detect and classify underwater objects from video feed or still images, built using OpenCV and deep learning techniques.

🔧 Tech Stack
Languages: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Models: CNN, Image Thresholding, Contour Detection

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VS Code
