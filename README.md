  ## 🧠 Projects Overview

  | # | Project | Description |
  |---|---------|------------|
  | 1️⃣ | **Capestone - Currency Node Authentication** | Verifies and authenticates Indian currency notes using image processing and edge detection techniques. Helps reduce counterfeit circulation. |
  | 2️⃣ | **Autonomous Dome Surveillance System** | Smart surveillance system with real-time object tracking and movement prediction for enhanced security in public or restricted spaces. |
  | 3️⃣ | **Food Quality Inspection using CNN** | Deep learning model classifying food quality (fresh, spoiled, etc.) using image-based features. Built with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). |
  | 4️⃣ | **Underwater Object Detection** | Detects and classifies underwater objects from video feeds or images using OpenCV and deep learning techniques. |
