  # 🚀 NM-2025 – AI & CV Projects

  This repository showcases **four innovative projects** built in 2025 as part of my **AI and Computer Vision** learning journey. These projects address real-world problems using a combination of **deep learning**, **image processing**, and **intelligent systems**.

  ## 🧠 Projects Overview

  | # | Project | Description |
  |---|---------|------------|
  | 1️⃣ | **Capestone - Currency Node Authentication** | Verifies and authenticates Indian currency notes using image processing and edge detection techniques. Helps reduce counterfeit circulation. |
  | 2️⃣ | **Autonomous Dome Surveillance System** | Smart surveillance system with real-time object tracking and movement prediction for enhanced security in public or restricted spaces. |
  | 3️⃣ | **Food Quality Inspection using CNN** | Deep learning model classifying food quality (fresh, spoiled, etc.) using image-based features. Built with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). |
  | 4️⃣ | **Underwater Object Detection** | Detects and classifies underwater objects from video feeds or images using OpenCV and deep learning techniques. |

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lekshmi82/NM-2025.git
cd NM-2025
2.Navigate into any project folder and follow the instructions (code is well-commented).
3.Run the scripts using Python or Jupyter Notebook, depending on the project.

🎯 Goals

These projects were developed to:

Apply AI and Computer Vision concepts to real-world problems
Build a hands-on portfolio for Naan Mudhalvan 2025 Projects
Learn project structuring, dataset handling, and model deployment basics
